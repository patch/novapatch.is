#### Wednesday, July 22, 4:10 p.m., E146

Unicode is much more than just characters. The Unicode Consortium defines open
standards for collating, parsing, and formatting data in much of the world‚Äôs
languages. The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) is the largest standard
repository of locale data along with specifications for its use, and is a
powerful resource for software localization.

The Unicode CLDR is quickly becoming the de facto locale standard with
widespread use among companies, including Google, Apple, and IBM; projects
ranging from Linux distributions to Wikipedia; and increasing support in many
programming languages. This talk provides an introduction to software
localization and highlights popular CLDR-based open source libraries in a
variety of programming languages.

Topics include localized formatting of:

 * Numbers, percents, and ranges of numbers
 * Prices and currencies
 * Dates and times
 * Localized sorting lists of strings

#### Thursday, July 23, 11:30 a.m., E145

Our personal identity is core to how we perceive ourselves and wish to be seen.
All too often, however, applications, databases, and user interfaces are not
designed to fully support the diversity of names expressed both locally and
internationally. This talk demonstrates ways to build applications that respect
users‚Äô identities instead of limiting them.

Topics include:

 * Input, validation, storage, and display of personal names
 * Unicode usernames and solutions to security concerns
 * Internationalization and localization considerations

Although names provide a powerful example and are the focus of this
presentation, much of the topic is relevant to all types of user input. The
intended audience includes programmers, UX designers, and QA testers. Together
we can build inclusive software that supports diverse identities.
