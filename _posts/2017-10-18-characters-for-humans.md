The <code>\X</code> Files: programming with extended grapheme clusters and emoji
sequences.

A “character” can mean different things to different people, but the largest
disparity is between applications and the humans who use them. Programmers
aren’t to blame, as our programming languages, libraries, and databases provide
little or no support for understanding user-perceived characters. Many systems
disagree on the basic units of characters, some use code points, others use code
units, and others still operate on individual bytes by default. This frequently
leads to products with a poor experience in some users’ languages, especially
written languages that use grapheme clusters, sequences of code points that
compose a single user-perceived character. With the rise in global emoji usage
and the rapid evolution of standard emoji sequences, this problem is
increasingly experienced by users worldwide, regardless of their language.

This presentation covers:
 * Extended grapheme clusters and emoji sequences 
 * Programming with these user-perceived characters 
 * Data input, parsing, analysis, formatting, and output 
 * Setting product requirements for character support 
 * Examples from Shutterstock’s platforms for content editing and collaboration
