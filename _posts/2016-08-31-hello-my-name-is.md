My newest talk *Hello, my name is ____________* on supporting diverse user
identities, presented at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/), [Open Source
Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/), [YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/), [AWS
Loft](https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/ny-loft/), and the
[Internationalization & Unicode Conference](http://www.unicodeconference.org/).
Here are the videos, slides, notes, and additional resources.

This presentation contains several examples provided by open source community
leader and gender equality advocate [Nóirín
Plunkett](https://twitter.com/noirinp), whose Irish name was frequently
mishandled in software. Nóirín has sadly [passed
away](https://adainitiative.org/2015/07/remembering-noirin-plunkett/) recently.
I’d like to thank Nóirín for their contributions to this presentation and to the
greater open source community.

### Description

Our personal identity is core to how we perceive ourselves and wish to be seen.
All too often, however, applications, databases, and user interfaces are not
designed to fully support the diversity of names expressed both locally and
internationally. This talk demonstrates ways to build applications that respect
users’ identities instead of limiting them.

Topics include:

 * Input, validation, storage, and display of personal names
 * Unicode usernames and solutions to security concerns
 * Internationalization and localization considerations

Although names provide a powerful example and are the focus of this
presentation, much of the topic is relevant to all types of user input. The
intended audience includes programmers, UX designers, and QA testers. Together
we can build inclusive software that supports diverse identities.
