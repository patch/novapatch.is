I attended my eighth [YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2015/) last week in Salt
Lake City, Utah, and presented a new talk titled
***Hello, my name is __________***. This talk is about the importance of
supporting the diversity of real-world users’ names in your software at all
levels: input, validation, storage, and display; and how we as developers, UX
designers, and QA testers can build inclusive applications that respect users’
identities instead of limiting them. Although names provide a powerful example
and are the focus of this presentation, much of the topic is relevant to all
types of user input.

### Notes

I’m still developing this talk for several upcoming conferences—[Open Source
Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/),
[OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015), and the [Internationalization &
Unicode Conference](http://www.unicodeconference.org/)—and it will be tailored
for the audience of each event. The main area I plan on expanding is Unicode
usernames for use as unique identifiers, as well as providing real-world
examples of names containing non-BMP characters. I’m also actively working on
expanding the open source [i18n Testing
Data](https://github.com/patch/i18n-testing) project that I manage on GitHub. If
you’re attending one of these upcoming conferences, I encourage you to wait and
see the presentation live in order to take advantage of these improvements and
be involved in the approximately ten minutes of time I’ll save for questions and
discussion.

Thanks to everyone who participated in the session and discussion! Please feel
free to contact me with questions at [@nickpatch](https://twitter.com/nickpatch)
or [patch@cpan.org](mailto:patch@cpan.org).
