You may have noticed a new name around these parts: Nova Patch.

I’m now using Nova as my primary name and invite others call me it. It’s not easy to change your name, especially as a regular speaker and long-time member of open source communities, but I’m excited about this change and appreciate everyone’s support.

Some of my social usernames have changed:

* I’m now @novapatch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/novapatch), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/novapatch), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/novapatch).
* I remain @patch on [GitHub](https://github.com/patch), [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/patch), and [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/PATCH), among others.
* The domain name for this website is now [novapatch.is](https://novapatch.is/).

Besides that, everything else is pretty much the same :)

*—Nova*
